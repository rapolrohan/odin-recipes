    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Panna cotta is a traditional, easy, and delicious Italian custard. I had a difficult time finding a good, simple recipe so I made up my own. It tastes just like the panna cotta served at Italian restaurants! </p>
    </p>
    <p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup skim milk</li>
        <li>1 (0.25 ounce) envelope unflavored gelatin</li>
        <li>2.5 cups heavy cream </li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1.5 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. </li>
            <li>Pour milk into a small bowl. Sprinkle gelatin powder over milk and stir until combined. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Stir heavy cream and sugar together in a saucepan. Set over medium heat and bring to a boil; watch carefully as the cream can quickly bubble up and boil over.</li>
            <li>Immediately stir gelatin mixture into boiling cream, stirring until completely dissolved. Cook and stir for 1 minute. </li>
            <li> Remove the pan from the heat and stir in vanilla.</li>
            <li>Pour cream mixture into 6 individual ramekins. Leave to cool, uncovered, until no longer warm, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>When cool, cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours but preferably overnight.</li>

        </ol>
